# react-native-confirmation-code-field

* We also import some helper functions and components from the `react-native-confirmation-code-field` library.

# Constants: 
* We define a constant `CELL_COUNT` which represents the number of cells in our code input field (6 cells in this case).

# Main Function: 
* We define a functional component called `App`. This is the main component of our application.

# State: 
* we use the `useState` hook to create a state variable `value` and a function `setValue` to update it. This will hold the code entered by the user.

# Props: 
* We call `useClearByFocusCell` to handle the cell focus behavior. It returns properties that we spread into our `CodeField` component.

# Refs: 
* We call `useBlurOnFulfill` to blur the input when the user has filled all cells. It takes the `value` and `cellCount` as parameters.

# Render: 
* The `return` statement defines the UI. We use a `SafeAreaView` as the container, a `Text` component for the title, and a `CodeField` component to handle the code input.

# Styles:
* At the bottom, we define some styles using `StyleSheet`.create to style our components.


# useClearByFocusCell
* This function returns two things:
* `props`: Some properties or settings needed for the input cells.
* `getCellOnLayoutHandler`: A function that handles the layout of each cell.

# getCellOnLayoutHandler
* It helps in shifting the focus to the next cell automatically, so you don't have to tap on the next cell yourself.

# useBlurOnFulfill: 
* When the user has filled all the cells (entered the complete code), useBlurOnFulfill will automatically blur the input field. Blurring means that the input field will lose focus, which can be a visual indication that the user has completed the task of entering the code.

* `ref` that is used to control the input field.

* The `{...props}` syntax uses the JavaScript spread operator.
It takes all the properties (or "props") from the `props` object and spreads them into the `CodeField` component.

* `renderCell`:  This is a prop (property) of the `CodeField` component. It defines how each individual cell (box) of the code field should be rendered (displayed).

* Function Parameter: The `({index, symbol, isFocused})` part is a function parameter. It's using destructuring to extract `index, symbol, and isFocused` from the object passed to the function.

* Parameters: 
* `index`: The position of the current cell in the sequence (0, 1, 2, etc.).
* `symbol`: The character (digit) currently entered in this cell.
* `isFocused`: A boolean `(true or false)` that tells if this cell is currently focused (active for typing).

* `Conditional Rendering`: This part of the code decides what to show inside each cell based on whether the cell is focused and if there's a symbol entered.

* `symbol`: If there is a symbol (digit) in the cell, it will be displayed.

* `isFocused`: If there isn't a symbol, it checks if the cell is focused:
* `<Cursor/>`: If the cell is focused, it shows a blinking cursor component.
* `null`: If the cell isn't focused and there's no symbol, it shows nothing (null).
